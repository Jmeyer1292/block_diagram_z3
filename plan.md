# Impl Plan

 * How to model timers?
 * Expand support to static calls
 * Standard project "build files" and analysis.
   * Should "just work" on a few "real" projects.
   * Support parsing more complicated UDT/DBs so long as they aren't "USED"
   * Cleanup demo experience with a real project.

## Not Supported (So Far)
 * Static data and FB calls
 * Default memory initializers
